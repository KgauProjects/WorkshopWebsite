    <h1>The Moog Company</h1>
    <div id="content">
        <p>The Moog company pioneered the <span>commercial</span> manufacture of modular voltage-controlled
            analog synthesizer systems in the early 1950s.The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical piano, invented 
            by Harold Rhodes during the fifties and later manufactured in a number of models.They look nearly 
            identical, but the top one has no space between #header and .callout while the bottom one does. 
            This small difference makes a huge difference in what it does. To some of you, that top selector
            may seem like a mistake, but it's actually a quite useful selector. Let's see the difference, what 
            that top selector means, and exploring more of that style selector. Here is the "plain English" of #header .callout: 
            Select all elements with the class name callout that are descendents of the element with an 
            ID of header.</div>
